An unusable PostgreSQL driver written in Elixir

This project is just a few hours old and is completely unusable.

The goal of this driver is to focus on speed and simplicity. Some very early
numbers show a ~25% speed increase over Postgrex. A secondary goal is to make
the library easier to use, specifically around prepared statements and extending
the library with custom types.
